Session 2: The Quiz Brain (JavaScript)

Here are the logic required to calculate the "Vegetable Personality."

One option for now is to keep the entire application in a single file, 
so we will add a <script> block at the bottom of the <body> in our corrected HTML file.

The steps to focus on:
1. Setting up Data: Define the logic that links answer combinations to a specific vegetable personality.
2. Listening for Submission: Attach an event handler to the form's submit action.
3. Processing Input: Read the user's selections from the HTML form elements.
4. Calculating the Result: Implement the if/else (or scoring) logic.
5. Displaying the Result: Update the content of the results area.

Step-by-Step Guide and Code Implementation:
The JavaScript code will be added inside a <script> tag, right before the closing </body> tag of the HTML file.

Step 1: Set Up the Quiz Data and Scoring System.
Instead of a simple score, a personality quiz is usually based on which answer "type" (A, B, or C) the user chooses most often. We'll assign a point to a corresponding vegetable type for each answer.

We need to define three vegetable personalities and link them to the question values:
Personality 1: The Root (Carrot): Represents deep thinkers, vibrant, grounded.
Q1: Research and strategy (q1_green)
Q2: Coffee (q2_coffee)
Q3: Quiet gathering (q3_quiet)

Personality 2: The Leafy Green (Spinach): Represents active, adaptable, quick energy.
Q1: Adapt quickly and stand firm (q1_red)
Q2: Tea (q2_tea)
Q3: Structured activity/Game Night (q3_game)

Personality 3: The Comfort Crop (Potato): Represents supportive, comforting, earthy.
Q1: Immediate comfort/support (q1_yellow)
Q2: Beer (q2_beer)
Q3: Big party (q3_party)

We will use a JavaScript object to track the score for each vegetable type.

Step 2: Implemenation of the JavaScript Logic in index.html file
